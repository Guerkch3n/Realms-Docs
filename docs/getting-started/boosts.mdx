# Realm Boosts

##### This article will give you a brief overview of the realm boosts

### What are realm boosts?

Realms have a lot of limitations per default. You can bypass some of these by boosting your realm.

Realm boosts can be bought using 200 rubies and players with the **Premium+** rank and higher get one free realm boost
they can use once a month. The term boost level means the number of boosts a realm has.

Boosting a realm shows support towards the realm, and it gives more freedom by lowering the realm's limitations.

Below, there's a grid explaining the perks a boost level gives you.

### How to boost a realm?

To boost a realm, open it using the realm menu (`/realm`). On the right-hand side, click the button with the arrow
pointing upwards to boost the realm. If you have the **Premium+** rank and you want to ignite your Premium+ Boost, click
the blue button to boost the realm. Or simply execute the command `/boost` on the Realm.

Keep in mind that boosts aren't refundable and you can't transfer the boost.
