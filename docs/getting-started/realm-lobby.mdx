# Realm Lobby

You can access the realm lobby by clicking the realm icon in the navigator. If you right-click the icon, the browser opens directly to the realm.

### Realm Browser

Clicking the rotating world in the realm lobby opens the realm browser. This menu includes two lists of realms. Right-clicking a realm automatically joins it, while left-clicking opens an [external menu](#realm-menu).

The top list shows your recently visited realms, which you joined through the browser. The bottom list contains all public realms, which you can sort by popularity (based on player count and boosts), count of players, boosts, or alphabetically. The search function allows you to search for public realms. If you want to search for private realms, use the search function in [My Realms](#my-realms) The five most popular realms (based on a popularity score) are highlighted on the podium.

### My Realms

You can access the **My Realms** menu by interacting with the NPC or right-clicking outside the browser.

This menu displays all realms you own or have favorited. You can search and filter this list to show only your realms or only your favored realms. If someone adds you to their whitelist, that realm will automatically be favorited for you. You can disable this using `/realm settings toggleMemberRealmsAutomaticallyFavorite`.

### Realm Menu

Left-clicking a realm opens an external menu where you can join the realm or boost it. If you have the necessary access, you can also manage the realm. This includes changing [settings](./settings), accessing the [web interface](../web-interface), or performing actions such as starting, stopping, restarting, or unloading the realm.
If you have **Premium+**, you can boost any realm for free every month. An explanation on the boost perks can be found [here](./boosts).
