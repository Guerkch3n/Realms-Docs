# Realm Settings

##### This guide will explain how to configure the realm to fit your needs

### Open the settings menu

To get to the settings of your realm, you need to execute the command `/realm` in-game.

If you're currently in the lobby and not on your realm, firstly, you need to open your realm by selecting it in the GUI of the **My Realms** NPC in the realms lobby.

Now you can access the settings of your realm by clicking the gear icon in the bottom right corner.

### Settings categories

Let's explain the categories by going top to bottom and left to right.

#### Realm icon

By clicking onto the banner item, you're able to change the icon of your realm and thus the way it's being displayed in the realm browser.

#### Realm name

By clicking onto the pencil icon next to your realm's name, you're able to change it to whatever you want. From Boost level 3 and up, you're able to use Bukkit color codes in the realm name.

#### Copy realm

By clicking onto the **Copy Realm** icon, you're able to copy your entire realm onto another one. Keep in mind that boosts won't be transferred onto the new realm.

#### Restore realm

There are backups of your realm being created every once in a while. If something bad happens to your realm (such as data loss or destruction of your world), you're able to restore a backup. Keep in mind that it'll wipe all the data on your realm and replace it with the backup. After some time, the backups get deleted.

#### Delete realm

This will delete your realm. Keep in mind that this is irreversible, and you won't be able to recover any of the files.

#### Set up subdomain

Once your realm reaches boost level 10, players will be able to join your realm directly from a subdomain. Click the edit icon and type the subdomain you want into the input field. After some time, players will be able to join your realm using that subdomain.

#### Change description

You can change the description of your realm. The description will be displayed in the realm browser alongside the realm name and its icon.

#### Whitelist

By enabling the whitelist, only select players can join your realm.

#### Player slots

Right next to the whitelist option, you can change the maximum number of players that the realm can have. The maximum number of player slots is [limited](./boosts#what-do-realm-boosts-give-to-a-realm) by the boost level of your realm.

#### Template

By changing the template of your realm, you're changing the plugins which will automatically be installed onto your realm. If you want to remove some plugins the templates offer, it'd be better to set the template to **Classic** and install the plugins manually.
